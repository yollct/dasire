<h2>Welcome !</h2>
<p>Direct Alternative Splicing Regulator predictor (DASiRe) is a web application that allows non-expert users to perform different types of splicing analysis from RNA-seq experiments and also incorporates ChIP-seq data of a DNA-binding protein of interest to evaluate whether its presence is associated with the splicing changes detected in the RNA-seq dataset.
DASiRe is an accessible web-based platform that performs the analysis of raw RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data to study the relationship between DNA-binding proteins and alternative splicing regulation. It provides a fully integrated pipeline that takes raw reads from RNA-seq and performs extensive splicing analysis by incorporating the three current methodological approaches to study alternative splicing: isoform switching, exon and event-level. Once the initial splicing analysis is finished, DASiRe performs ChIP-seq peak enrichment in the spliced genes detected by each one of the three approaches.</p>
